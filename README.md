**Status**.

- So at the moment, we have a functioning back end but from my limited understanding of Java I have been advised that this front end code is out date to the point it would be more practical to simply rebuild a fresh front end and to delete this entirely.
- If anyone is willing to take on the task of restoring and updating the above I welcome further contributions from developers who would be generous enough to give up their free time to restore functionity - I would be hugely grateful.
- Please get in touch via eve online Dexomus Viliana - or @scottshdex on twitter - I have the required resources in terms of infrastructure for testing etc so it would be a case of getting in touch.
- Discord contact - dex7252 or indeed get in touch with Zeratul at Wingspan - I am sure we can arrange for compensation that would be suitable ingame.
