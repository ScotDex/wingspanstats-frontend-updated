# Wingspan Delivery Services Statistics (frontend)

## Usage

Build the package:

```bash
npm install
npm run prod
```

Transfer `dest` folder contents to target server. In `dest` directory run:

```bash
composer install
```

Get the backend for statistics from (https://github.com/ScotDex/wingspanstats)

Status.

At the moment I have troubleshooted the code extensively and managed to eliminate all console errors to the point where I can run the install procedure and build the application.

Still runs with a bunch of SAAS errors from what my limited understanding of coding can grasp is a dependency that builds CSS files.

Also getting a blank screen on HTML but I am advised by one of the contributors that its simply a case of amending this to suit.
